# Howdy! 🤠

My name is Curtis Mitchell. I'm a software engineer focused on privacy-enhancing technologies, machine-learning and artificial intelligence, and full-stack web development. I currently work for the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) on the [xD team](https://xd.gov/). Previously I worked as a contractor for NASA on the [SimLabs](https://www.nasa.gov/simlabs/) team at the Ames Research Center, and before that I worked for several data science and machine learning startups. I've also volunteered as an open-source contributor with [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) and other open-source projects. I grew up in Texas and Missouri and now hang my hat in San Francisco, California. When I'm not behind a keyboard you can usually find me cooking something tasty 🥘🌮🍜, exercising 💪🏼, learning and practicing languages 🇯🇵🇫🇷🇩🇪, or reading a good book 📚.
