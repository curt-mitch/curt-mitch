# Howdy! 🤠

My name is Curtis Mitchell. I'm a software developer focused on machine-learning and artificial intelligence, privacy-enhancing technologies, and full-stack web development. I currently work for the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) on the [xD team](https://xd.gov/), and I am also an open-source contributor and core team member of [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/). Previously I worked as a contractor for NASA on the [SimLabs](https://www.nasa.gov/simlabs/) team at the Ames Research Center, and before that I worked for several data science and machine learning startups. I grew up in Texas and Missouri and now call San Francisco, California my home. When I'm not behind a keyboard you can usually find me cooking 🥘🌮🍜, mixing drinks 🍹🍸, exercising 💪🏼, or reading a good book 📚.
