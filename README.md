# Howdy! 🤠

My name is Curtis Mitchell. I'm a software engineer with experience in data privacy, machine-learning/AI, and cloud and web applications. I currently work for the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) on the [xD team](https://xd.gov/). I'm also available for part-time freelancing and consulting on privacy and ML/AI tech through my business [Mitchell Technology Consulting](https://mitchell-technology-consulting.com/). Previously I worked as a contractor for NASA on the [SimLabs](https://www.nasa.gov/simlabs/) team at the Ames Research Center, and before that I worked for several data science and machine learning startups. I've also volunteered as an open-source contributor with organizations like [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) and [OpenDP](https://opendp.org/). I grew up in Texas and Missouri and now hang my hat in San Francisco, California. When I'm not behind a keyboard you can usually find me cooking something tasty 🥘🌮🍜, exercising 💪🏼, learning and practicing languages 🇯🇵🇩🇪🇲🇽, or reading a good book 📚.
